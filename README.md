# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems from LeetCode. The solutions are written in C++ and are organized by problem type. Below is a list of the problems I have solved, along with a brief description of each file.

## Files and Descriptions

1. **AddTwoNums.cpp**
   - Problem: Add two numbers represented by linked lists.
   - Solution: Implements a function to add two numbers represented as linked lists and return the sum as a new linked list.

2. **BinaryTreePostorder.cpp**
   - Problem: Postorder traversal of a binary tree.
   - Solution: Implements a recursive algorithm to traverse a binary tree in postorder.

3. **BinaryTreePreorder.cpp**
   - Problem: Preorder traversal of a binary tree.
   - Solution: Implements a recursive algorithm to traverse a binary tree in preorder.

4. **ContainsDuplicate.cpp**
   - Problem: Check if an array contains any duplicates.
   - Solution: Solves the problem by using a hash set to identify if duplicates exist.

5. **LongestSubstring.cpp**
   - Problem: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
   - Solution: Implements a sliding window technique to find the longest substring with unique characters.

6. **MaximumDepth.cpp**
   - Problem: Find the maximum depth of a binary tree.
   - Solution: Implements a recursive function to calculate the depth of a binary tree.

7. **MergeSortedArray.cpp**
   - Problem: Merge two sorted arrays.
   - Solution: Efficiently merges two sorted arrays into one sorted array.

8. **RemoveDuplicateFromSortedList.cpp**
   - Problem: Remove duplicates from a sorted linked list.
   - Solution: Removes duplicates from a sorted linked list by iterating through the list and adjusting pointers.

9. **RomanToInteger.cpp**
   - Problem: Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.
   - Solution: Implements an algorithm to convert Roman numerals to integer values based on predefined rules.

10. **RotateList.cpp**
    - Problem: Rotate a linked list by k places.
    - Solution: Efficiently rotates a singly linked list by k places using two pointers.

11. **SearchInsertPosition.cpp**
    - Problem: Find the position to insert a number in a sorted array.
    - Solution: Uses binary search to find the appropriate index for insertion.

12. **TwoSum.cpp**
    - Problem: Find two numbers in an array that sum up to a given target.
    - Solution: Solves the problem using a hash map for efficient lookups.

## Additional Problems

- **BalancedBinaryTree.cpp**  
   - Problem: Check if a binary tree is balanced.
   - Solution: Implements a solution to determine if the binary tree is height-balanced.

- **PascalsTriangle1.cpp**  
   - Problem: Generate the first n rows of Pascal's Triangle.
   - Solution: Generates the triangle iteratively.

- **PascalsTriangle2.cpp**  
   - Problem: Generate the nth row of Pascal's Triangle.
   - Solution: Efficiently calculates the nth row using dynamic programming.
